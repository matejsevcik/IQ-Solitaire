# IQ-Solitaire
Solves the IQ Solitaire puzzle game.


To use it, copy a sample input from "all_inputs.txt" to "input.txt" and run the program.

The sample input looks like this (the first line represents the position of the target square):


3-3<br>
xx000xx<br>
xx010xx<br>
0011100<br>
0001000<br>
0001000<br>
xx000xx<br>
xx000xx<br>


Running with inputs 8 and 9 is not recommended. To solve them, use the reverse-engineering branch.
